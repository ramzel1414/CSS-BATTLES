# Daily CSS

- at first, this repository was only created to practice git (add, cm, push). 

- until it become my daily css challenge using only position: absolute and display: mekus mekus (for now) 

- there are no restraints and I can use any resources I have.

- I finished 52 days (Feb.1 - Mar.23) before starting a youtube.
